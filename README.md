Theoretically a third party page could send POST of data, Joel saves it as a CPP file, tries to compile it, and gives errors or runs the compiled executable, providing std output to the user.

Theoretically would be able to take parameters.  I've had this <a href="HTTPS://github.com/Bango1999/cpphp">working</a> very precariously before on a nitrous.io free PHP deployment.

Use at your own risk, and eventually to your own undoing.

Joel is kind of a namesake, a person I know to respresent the zany architecture of the module itself, acting as a sort of tribute to the man himself.
