Theoretically a third party page could send POST of data, Joel saves it as a CPP file, tries to compile it, and gives errors or runs the compiled executable, providing std output to the user.

Theoretically would be able to take parameters.  I've had this working very precariously before on a nitrous.io free node deployment.

Use at your own risk, and eventually to your own undoing.

The name Joel is based off of the zany Uncle of a good friend I had growing up.  A quirky and resourceful fellow, to be sure!

Requirements
- Node
- #!/bin/bash
- sufficient privelages to do all the things
- sorry for incomplete readme, just throwing this up for now
